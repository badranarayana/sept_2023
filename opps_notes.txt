Scripts --> directly writing code/ can't re use the code out side the file
test.py
-------
a = 10
b = 20
print("Sum of a and b", a + b)


functions:
--> reusable of code
--> define once and reuse within the file/across project

test.py
------
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

sum(10, 20)
sum(30, 40)

test2.py
-------
from test import sum
sum(30, 40)

# object oriented programming
--> class  --> class is an blueprint which contains
                member variables and methods/function
                variables --> store state/data
                methods/function --> actions on data

syntax:
------

class <class_name>:
    # variables
    # methods

example:
-------
# defining class

class Student:
    school_name="ZPH" # class variable

    def get_info(self):
        print("Student Details here")

# using class
# object create
student1 = Student() # it create an object and store student1

# accessing members from class(using .)
student1.school_name  # it gets the zph

# calling methods
student1.get_info() # python pass object reference to self implicitly

# how many times can create instance for a class?
--> we can create unlimited instances/objects of class
